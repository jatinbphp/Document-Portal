Before you start=====================================

Congratulations on taking the first step to reaching more supporters and raising more money for your charity.

To make the sign-up process as quick and easy as possible, please make sure you have the following to hand as you’ll need this to complete your application:

Your charity registration number and/or Gift Aid number (HMRC reference)
Contact details for two of your charity’s trustees and their dates of birth. If your charity only has one trustee, you will need to provide this information for a director/controller.
Government issued ID* (valid driver’s license or passport) for two of your charity’s trustees/controllers.
Your charity’s bank account details for receiving payments.
A scan of a recent bank statement dated within the last three months for the account where your funds will be disbursed. This needs to be in your registered charity name.
If your charity has a Gift Aid number, you can complete a ChV1 form once your application has been submitted. This is on the 'Confirm' page. Without this, Gift Aid can't be added to donations made on our platform. You will need your authorised officials details to complete this, including their National Insurance numbers. This is a HMRC requirement. 

*ID documents have to be a scan of an original document and in colour. We cannot accept a scan of a copy or documents that are not in date. It must be a clear image with the entirety of the document visible. We'd advise against using a flash, to avoid a glare. 

*Don’t worry if you don’t have a Gift Aid number yet. You can complete our online ChV1 form on receipt of your reference number from the HMRC.


 Yes, I understand. Let's do this!



Essentials =================================================


Who you are

charity name *
Is your organisation known by any other name? Don't worry - you'll have the opportunity to add another working name at the end of this application. This is the name that will be used on your page.

charity category *
Please select a category that best suits your charitable organisation i.e if you are an animal rescue centre, you would pick Animal Protection.

Charity registration number *
This is the number given to you by the Charity Commission, the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR), or your respective governing body. You can add in more than one number by separating them with a comma.

Gift Aid number 
Don’t worry if you haven’t got one. As long as you have a charity registration number you can still sign up - you just need one or the other. The Gift Aid number needs to start with 2 characters followed by up to 5 digits i.e. XR12345

Countries your organisation services * 
Please list the country(ies) your organisation provides services in and where funds raised on JustGiving may be spent

Document Upload - Deed (optional)

If your charity's trustees are not listed with the relevant charity commission, you will need to provide evidence of this by uploading your trustee deed*

This mainly concerns charities that are registered in Scotland and the Channel Islands where trustees are not publicly listed with their local charity commission. If your charity is incorporated, we are happy to accept a register of trustees which has been submitted to the relevant charity commission.



*This must clearly indicate your charity's current trustees, as per the details you have previously entered.
